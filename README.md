# Vehicle

The project aims to develop a backend (Net) and frontend (Angular) platform that allows us to carry out CRUDs of Vehicles and categories.
As we can see above, we have the 2 projects:
1) **Backend project**: Vehicle Frontend (Net)
2) **Frontend project**: VehicleApi (Angular)
   
We also have a SqlServer database in which we will create a new database with its respective tables:
**Database Name**: Vehicle
**Tables**:
-Category
-Vehicle

You can run the following script([a VehicleDatabaseScript.sql](VehicleDatabaseScript.sql)) to create the database with its respective tables.

Clone this repository locally:

```console
git clone https://github.com/marcosmella/Vehicle.git
```
> **IMPORTANTE** Then in each project you will have a readme to know how to run it
